        <p>
Shells are commonly used in all Operating Systems, such as PowerShell on Windows, bash/dash/fish on Linux, bash/zsh/tcsh on Mac
OS X, etc. All the shells provide powerful capabilities to allow user to find and run other programs on the system, and allow
users to write scripts to chain different commands to work together to complete more complicated tasks. With that besing said,
there is usually a steep curve for users to master all the knowledge needed to achieve what they want to do, from learning all
the different commands available, the usage of each command including combinations of supported parameters, as well as how to 
write script in the shell supported syntax. Besides, both the shell input and output are usually in plain text, which implicits
that users have to read restricted output in plain text to understand the data, and there is no way to interact with the data
unless you re-run the command(s).
        </p>
        <p>
Leave Script Behind (aka LSB) is an application and platform designed to address the pain points. It help users to reduce effort
needed on learning so many different commands for duplicated tasks, they can simply take the benefit of running existing views
created by others to achieve what they want to do. and it also enhances the experience that how the users can interact with the
data generated/collected by the commands in the views.

        <h2>View Repositories</h2>
        <h3>Default View Repository</h3>
        <p>
The default view repository is loaded at https://github.com/xjluo-lsb/lsb.views. The LSB will automatically enlist all the
views created in this repository.
        </p>
        <h3>User Defined Repositories</h3>
        <p>
Users may also define their own repositories to be used in the LSB.
