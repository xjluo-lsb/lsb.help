Shells are commonly used in all Operating Systems, such as PowerShell on Windows, bash on Linux, zsh on Mac OS X, etc. Shells
provide powerful capabilities to allow user to write scripts and chain different commands to achieve certain task goal. In the
meantime, there is steep curve for users to master all the knowledge needed to smoothly achieve what they want to do. Besides,
the shell output is usually in plain text, which implicits the form of output is quite restricted, and there is difficulty for
users to manipulate with the result generated by the commands/scripts.

Leave Script Behind (aka LSB) is an application and platform designed to help users to reduce effort needed on remembering so
many different commands for duplicated tasks, and it also enhances the experience that how the users can interact with the
data generated/collected by the commands.
