</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<p>LSB views are organized and accessed through view repositories, which may reside either locally on the user’s machine or remotely in a Git-based source. Within each repository, views can be further organized into folders and sub‑folders to create a structured hierarchy. When the LSB application loads the available views, it recursively scans the entire directory tree under the repository’s root folder and displays all discovered view files in the view list shown in the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog.</p>
<p>Multiple views may share the same file name within a single repository; as long as they are located in different folders, they can coexist without conflict.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
Default View Repository</h2>
<p>The LSB application includes a built‑in default view repository, which is a Git repository hosted at:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xjluo-lsb/lsb.views">https://github.com/xjluo-lsb/lsb.views</a></p>
<p>When the LSB application is launched, it checks whether this default repository is already available locally. If it is missing, the application automatically clones the Git repository so that the default views become immediately accessible to the user.</p>
<p>This repository is internally named <b>DefaultViews</b>, and its configuration is managed entirely by the application. Because it is a core component of the system, it cannot be modified or removed through the repository‑configuration page in the <b>Settings</b> dialog.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
User Configured View Repositories</h2>
<p>Users may define additional view repositories to extend or customize their LSB environment.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
Local‑Only Repositories</h3>
<p>A user can configure a repository that exists solely on the local machine by specifying a local folder as the <b>Local view root</b> and leaving the <b>Git repository URL</b> field empty. In this configuration, all views are stored and accessed locally, and no synchronization with a remote source occurs. These views remain private to the user unless shared manually.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Remote Git‑Backed Repositories</h3>
<p>Users may also configure a repository that synchronizes with a remote Git source by providing both a <b>Git repository URL</b> and a corresponding <b>Local view root</b> folder. Whenever the LSB application starts, it automatically synchronizes the local folder with the remote Git repository, ensuring that all LSB views are up to date. This setup allows users to reuse views created by others or distribute their own views across a team or organization.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Temporarily Enabling or Disabling Repositories</h3>
<p>Within the repository settings, users may toggle the option <b>“The repository is enabled to use the views hosted in it.”</b> Disabling a repository hides all of its views from the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog without deleting the repository or its files. This feature is particularly useful when many repositories are configured and the view list becomes too long; temporarily disabling some repositories helps reduce clutter and streamline navigation.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
Sample Views</h2>
<p>In the <b>DefaultViews</b> repository, the LSB application includes a collection of sample views located under the <span class="tt">samples</span> and <span class="tt">common</span> folders. These sample views illustrate the range of view controls available in LSB, demonstrate how an LSB view behaves in practice, and show how parameter values can be passed, transformed, and consumed across different components. They serve as practical, hands‑on examples for users who want to learn how to design and build their own LSB views.</p>
<p>Below are several representative examples drawn from these sample folders:</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>

<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
Graphs and Charts</h3>
<p>There are 3 graph and chart sample views available, using different frameworks to draw the graphs and charts. </p><ul>
<li>
<b>chartjs-sample.lsbv</b> - This view uses the Chart.js library inside <a class="el" href="class_web_view.html" title="This WebView is a data view control for displaying data through Web page form.">WebView</a> control to visualize data. Credit to the contributors of the Chart.js library. Please visit <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">https://www.chartjs.org/</a> to find more details about the library. </li>
<li>
<b>d3-sample.lsbv</b> - This is another view uses the <a class="el" href="class_web_view.html" title="This WebView is a data view control for displaying data through Web page form.">WebView</a> control to render the graphs, while it uses the well-known D3 library (<a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a>) to visualize the data. It contains three examples copied and modified from the original D3 samples. The Scatterplot is based on <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatterplot-tour">https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatterplot-tour</a>, the Disjoint force-directed graph is based on <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph/2">https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph/2</a> and the Zoomable circle packing comes from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing">https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing</a>. </li>
<li>
<b>chartview-sample.lsbv</b> - This sample view mainly demonstrates the <a class="el" href="class_chart_view.html" title="This ChartView is a data view control that uses the wxChart control to render data as charts.">ChartView</a> in the LSB. It shows examples for all the chart types supported by <a class="el" href="class_chart_view.html" title="This ChartView is a data view control that uses the wxChart control to render data as charts.">ChartView</a>, including Bar chart, Stacked bar chart, <a class="el" href="class_column.html" title="This node defines the attributes on the Column node to be used in the ListView and TreeListView contr...">Column</a> chart, Stacked column chart, Candlestick chart, Box plot, OHLC chart, Histogram, Pie chart, Polar area chart, Doughnut chart, Bubble chart, Scatter plot, Line chart, Math2D plot and Area chart. The data used in these charts are generated from Lua script that is defined in the script reference in the view. The <a class="el" href="class_chart_view.html" title="This ChartView is a data view control that uses the wxChart control to render data as charts.">ChartView</a> control is built on top the wxCharts library.

</ul>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md34"></a>
hexview.lsbv</h3>
<p>This view illustrates how the <a class="el" href="class_hex_view.html" title="This HexView control is a data view control that displays binary data in the hexadecimal format.">HexView</a> control provided by LSB can be used to display data or file in the hexadecimal form. It can open any file to be displayed in hexadecimal. This view demonstrates two different ways to load the file content into the <a class="el" href="class_hex_view.html" title="This HexView control is a data view control that displays binary data in the hexadecimal format.">HexView</a> control, </p><ul>
<li>
Load file in Lua code, convert the content into hexadecimal string and send to the <a class="el" href="class_hex_view.html" title="This HexView control is a data view control that displays binary data in the hexadecimal format.">HexView</a> control. This way can be used for displaying any data as long as the data is preprocessed to be hexadecimal string. </li>
<li>
Send the file path to the <a class="el" href="class_hex_view.html" title="This HexView control is a data view control that displays binary data in the hexadecimal format.">HexView</a> control and load the content directly in <a class="el" href="class_hex_view.html" title="This HexView control is a data view control that displays binary data in the hexadecimal format.">HexView</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>A substantial collection of example views is already included in the default view repository, and this library will continue to grow over time as additional views are added. Users are encouraged to explore and experiment with these examples to understand the capabilities of LSB views, observe how different controls behave, and study how parameters are passed and processed. These sample views serve not only as demonstrations of what LSB can do, but also as practical reference material for learning how to design and build your own custom LSB views. </p>
