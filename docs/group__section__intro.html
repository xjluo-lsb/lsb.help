Welcome to Leave Script Behind (LSB)!</h1>
<p>Leave Script Behind (aka LSB) is a tool developed for developers, more specifically, DevOps.</p>
<p>Since from the invention of the Internet, more and more services are moved to the online world. This implies that developers are now working in the DevOps mode, they inevitably need to work with shells and command line tools for their daily work, from service deployment to live site investigation and mitigation. Depends on which operating systems they are using on their machine, they may need to interact with different types of command-line shells, such as <b>PowerShell</b> on <b>Windows</b>, <b>GNU bash</b> on <b>Linux</b>, and <b>zsh</b> on <b>Mac OS X</b>, etc.</p>
<p>The shells are known as providing capabilities to allow user to run commands/programs on operating systems, and allow users to create scripts to chain commands as needed to complete complicated tasks, and then repeat the same work later by simply run the script solely. Along with the flexibility and great power come with the shells and scripts, there is also a steep learning curve for new users to master all the knowledge needed to achieve what they want to do, from learning the different commands provided by the shell(s), to mastering the usage of each command, including various parameters, unique parameter values, combinations of the parameters, as well as writing shell scripts in correct syntax. Besides, both the shell input and output are usually presented in plain text in the shell console, which means that users must have knowledge beforehand to understand the constraint output in plain text. There is no way for user to interact with the result data after it's outputted in the shell console in plain text, unless user re-runs the command and stores the result into a variable in a shell supported way, then user may manipulate the variable to digest more.</p>
<p>LSB is a cross-platform tool designed with the goal to reduce the pain decribed above - it chains multiple sequences of shell scripts and commands to complete a complicated task, allows user to interact with data in the middle through GUI, provides a way to store and reuse the same processes (named LSB views) later for the same tasks. It can display the data output from command(s) at each step in a manipulatable way, user can interact with the data to create the input for the next step (the next sequence of commands), and so on, step by step, till the workflow reaches its end and user completes a difficult task. By reusing the LSB views, it can greatly ease the user's work by avoiding remembering all the shell commands needed, their parameters used, and error-prone parameter combinations, as well as repetitively executing same commands again and again. Each LSB view provides funtionality similiar to a script file but offers much richer capabilities such as,</p><ul>
<li>Data visualizaion through various view controls like list view, tree view, chart view and many others.</li>
<li>Interaction with the intermediate data, select different data entries to continue the workflow with different logic and actions.</li>
<li>Multiple input controls available for users to input values in various data types, from integer, string, to files, etc.</li>
<li>Layout capability to arrange the input controls and data view controls through simple XML configuration.</li>
<li>Embedded support for data connectivity to SQL databases, Web APIs, etc. with configuration defined in the view file.</li>
<li>Lua language intergation in LSB for data generation and task execution.</li>
<li>Extensibility to support any shell type that the host operating system supports for running shell scripts to implement desired functionalities.</li>
<li>Ability to mix multiple script snippets in the same type or different types (e.g., Lua, PowerShell, bash, zsh) in the same view to complete complicated tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing these capabilities, the LSB can help to address the user's pain points,</p><ul>
<li>It reduces the effort required for end users to learn various script languages and commands. End users only need to learn how to use the LSB views to complete tasks, without needing to know the underlying commands and scripts, as the GUI views are more intuitive than their command line counterparts. For developers, LSB views can be implemented using their preferred shells/languages, and they can also mix different shells within a single LSB view to create the most effective workflow.</li>
<li>It significantly enhances the experience on how the end users can interact with the intermediate data generated from a set of commands,<ul>
<li>Allow users to view the data in well-organized formats like list view, tree view, etc.</li>
<li>Enable data visualization in various graph types, including but not limited to bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and heat maps.</li>
<li>Allow users to select data entries (using mouse) as input for subsequent workflow steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Lua language embedded within LSB ensures cross-platform compatibility. By utilizing only Lua scripts within a LSB view, the view can operate seamlessly across all platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac <a class="el" href="class_o_s.html" title="This is the OS type that defines which operating system the LSB view supports.">OS</a> X.</li>
<li>Uploading a LSB view to the LSB repository makes it accessible to all LSB users, allowing any user to reuse the views created by others effortlessly. This is also an easy way for the view developers to pushlish their work, and get acknowledged by other developers and users. </li>
