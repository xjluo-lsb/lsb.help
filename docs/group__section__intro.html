Welcome to the Leave Script Behind!</h1>
<p>Leave Script Behind (aka LSB) is a tool developed for software developers, more specifically, DevOps.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the Internet, an increasing number of services have shifted into the online domain. As a result, more developers now operate in a DevOps model, aiming to deliver features and products both quickly and safely. To support this workflow, they inevitably rely on shells and command‑line tools in their daily tasks — from deploying services to investigating and mitigating live‑site issues. Depending on the operating system they use, developers may need to work with different command‑line shells, such as <b>PowerShell</b> on <b>Windows</b>, <b>GNU bash</b> on <b>Linux</b>, or <b>zsh</b> on <b>macOS</b>, among others.</p>
<p>Shells give users the ability to run commands and programs on an operating system, as well as write scripts that chain multiple commands together to accomplish complex tasks. Once a script is created, users can easily repeat the same workflow simply by running it again. However, the flexibility and power of shells come with a steep learning curve. New users must learn the available commands, understand how each one works, and become familiar with parameters, valid parameter values, and the many ways these can be combined. They also need to understand how to link commands together and write shell scripts with correct syntax and logic. In addition, shell input and output are typically shown as plain text in a console, so users must already know how to interpret that text. After output appears in the console, there is no built‑in way to interact with it directly; users must rerun the command and capture the result into a variable if they want to further process or analyze the data.</p>
<p>LSB is a cross‑platform tool created to address the challenges described above. It orchestrates multiple sequences of shell commands and scripts to carry out complex tasks, while allowing users to interact with intermediate data through a graphical interface. It also enables users to save and reuse these workflows — called LSB views — whenever they need to perform the same tasks again.</p>
<p>Depending on how a view is designed, it can present the output of each command step in an interactive format, letting users manipulate the data to produce the input for the next step. This continues step by step until the workflow reaches its final state and the task is completed. Reusing LSB views significantly reduces the user’s burden by eliminating the need to remember numerous shell commands, their parameters, and the often error‑prone combinations of arguments, as well as avoiding repetitive manual execution.</p>
<p>Each LSB view functions similarly to a script file but provides far richer capabilities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rich data visualization:</b> Output can be presented through UI components such as list views, tree views, chart views, and more — far more readable and informative than plain text.</li>
<li><b>Interactive intermediate data:</b> Users can act on intermediate results directly, selecting different entries to drive the workflow forward with different logic or actions.</li>
<li><b>Versatile input controls:</b> A variety of input components support multiple data types, including integers, strings, and files. The <span class="tt"><a class="el" href="class_property_input.html" title="The PropertyInput is an input control that supports editing multiple variables or complicated structu...">PropertyInput</a></span> control enables users to supply multiple parameters through a single, consolidated interface. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Flexible layout configuration:</b> Input controls and data‑view components can be arranged using simple XML‑based layout definitions, making it easy to design custom interfaces.</li>
<li><b>Built‑in data connectivity:</b> LSB includes configurable support for connecting to SQL databases, Web APIs, and other data sources directly from the view file. This feature will be fully available in the next release.</li>
<li><b>Lua integration:</b> Lua scripting is embedded within LSB to support dataset creation, data transformation, and task execution.</li>
<li><b>Shell extensibility:</b> LSB can work with any shell supported by the host operating system. As long as shell support is configured, LSB can execute scripts in that environment to implement the desired functionality. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Mixed‑language scripting:</b> A single view can combine multiple script snippets — whether in the same language or across different languages (e.g., Lua, PowerShell, bash, zsh) — to accomplish complex, multi‑step workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>By offering these capabilities, LSB helps alleviate several key pain points for users:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>For end users</b>, LSB minimizes the need to learn multiple scripting languages and command‑line tools. Users only need to understand how to operate LSB views to complete their tasks, since the graphical interface is far more intuitive than raw command‑line interactions.</li>
<li><b>For developers</b>, LSB views can be built using whichever shells or languages they prefer, and they can freely combine different shells within a single view to construct the most efficient workflow.</li>
<li><b>For both groups</b>, LSB greatly improves how users interact with intermediate data produced by command sequences, by enabling:<ul>
<li>Clear, structured data presentation through list views, tree views, and similar UI components. <br  />
</li>
<li>Rich data visualization using various chart types, such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, heat maps, and more. <br  />
</li>
<li>Direct interaction with data entries — users can select items with the mouse to feed into subsequent workflow steps. <br  />
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Cross‑platform consistency</b> is ensured through LSB’s embedded Lua engine. A view implemented entirely in Lua can run seamlessly across Windows, Linux, and macOS without modification.</li>
<li><b>Easy sharing and reuse</b> are supported through the LSB repository. Uploading a view makes it instantly available to all LSB users, allowing others to reuse the workflow effortlessly. This also provides a simple way for view developers to publish their work and gain recognition from the broader community. </li>
</ul>
