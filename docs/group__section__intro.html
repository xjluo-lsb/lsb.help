Welcome to the Leave Script Behind!</h1>
<p>Leave Script Behind (aka LSB) is a tool developed for developers, more specifically, DevOps.</p>
<p>Since from the invention of the Internet, more and more services are moved to the online world. This implies that more and more developers are now working in the DevOps mode to make their products/features released fast and safe. To achieve that, they inevitably need to work with shells and command line tools in their daily work, from service deployment to live site investigation and mitigation. Depends on which operating systems they are using, they may need to interact with different types of shells in the command line form (CLI), such as <b>PowerShell</b> on <b>Windows</b>, <b>GNU bash</b> on <b>Linux</b>, and <b>zsh</b> on <b>Mac OS X</b>, etc.</p>
<p>The shells are known as providing capabilities to allow user to run commands/programs on operating systems, and allow users to create scripts to chain commands as needed to complete complicated tasks, and then repeat the same work later by simply run the script solely. Along with the strong flexibility and great power come with the shells and scripts, there is also a steep learning curve for new users to master all the knowledge needed to achieve what they want to do, from learning the different commands available in the shell(s), to grasping the usage of each command, including various parameters, unique parameter values, combinations of the parameters and values, as well as how to chain the commands and write corresponding shell scripts in correct syntax and logic. Besides, both the shell input and output are usually presented in plain text in the shell console, which means that users must have knowledge beforehand to understand the constraint output in plain text. There is no way for user to interact with the result data after it's already outputted in the shell console, unless user re-runs the command and stores the result into a variable in the shell supported way, then user may manipulate the variable to digest more from it.</p>
<p>LSB is a cross-platform tool designed with the goal to reduce the pain decribed above - it chains multiple sequences of shell scripts and commands to complete a complicated task, allows user to interact with data in the middle through GUI, provides a way to store and reuse the same processes (named LSB views) later for the same tasks. Depends on how a view is designed, it can display the data output from command(s) at each step in a manipulatable way, user can interact with the data to create the input for the next step (the next sequence of commands), and so on, step by step, till the workflow reaches its end state and user completes the task. By reusing the LSB views, it can greatly ease the user's work by avoiding remembering all the shell commands needed, their parameters, and the error-prone parameter combinations, as well as repetitively executing same commands again and again. Each LSB view provides funtionality similiar to a script file but offers much richer capabilities,</p><ul>
<li>Data visualizaion through various view controls like list view, tree view, chart view and many others, instead of very limited plain text form.</li>
<li>Interaction with the intermediate data, users may select different entries in the intermediate data to continue the workflow with different logic and actions.</li>
<li>Multiple input controls available for users to input values in various data types, from integer, string, to files, etc. It provides the <a class="el" href="class_property_input.html" title="The PropertyInput is an input control that supports editing multiple variables or complicated structu...">PropertyInput</a> control to support multiple parameter input in one single control.</li>
<li>Layout capability to arrange the input controls and data view controls through simple XML configuration.</li>
<li>Embedded support for data connectivity to SQL databases, Web APIs, etc. with configuration defined in the view file. This feature will be available soon in next release.</li>
<li>Lua language intergation in LSB for dataset creation, data processing and task execution.</li>
<li>Extensibility to support any shell type that the host operating system supports. LSB can run any shell scripts to implement desired functionalities as long as the shell support is configured properly.</li>
<li>Ability to mix multiple script snippets in the same type or different types (e.g., Lua, PowerShell, bash, zsh) in the same view to complete complicated tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing these capabilities, the LSB can help to address the user's following pain points,</p><ul>
<li>For end users, it reduces their effort needed to learn various script languages and commands. They only need to learn how to use the LSB views to complete tasks, without needing to know the underlying commands and scripts, as the GUI views are more intuitive than their command line counterparts.</li>
<li>For developers, the LSB views can be implemented using their preferred shells/languages, and they can also mix different shells within a single LSB view to create the most effective workflow for them.</li>
<li>It significantly enhances the experience on how the end users can interact with the intermediate data generated from a set of commands,<ul>
<li>Allow users to view the data in well-organized formats like list view, tree view, etc.</li>
<li>Enable data visualization in various graph types, including but not limited to bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and heat maps, etc.</li>
<li>Allow users to select data entries (using mouse) as input for subsequent workflow steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Lua language embedded within LSB ensures cross-platform compatibility. By utilizing Lua scripts only within a LSB view, the view can operate seamlessly across all platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac <a class="el" href="class_o_s.html" title="This is the OS type that defines which operating system that the LSB view supports.">OS</a> X.</li>
<li>Uploading an LSB view to the LSB repository makes it accessible to all LSB users, allowing any user to reuse the views created by others effortlessly. This is also an easy way for the view developers to pushlish their work, and get acknowledged by other developers and users. </li>
</ul>
