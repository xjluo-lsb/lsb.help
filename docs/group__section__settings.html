<div class="contents">
<p>The LSB <b>Settings</b> dialog provides users with the ability to configure a wide range of behaviors and preferences within the LSB application. All available settings are grouped into four major categories — <b>General</b>, <b>Colors &amp; Fonts</b>, <b>Shells</b>, and <b>Views</b> — each covering a different aspect of the application’s functionality. The following sections describe these categories in detail, explaining the purpose of each option and illustrating how individual settings influence the overall operation and appearance of the LSB application.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
General category</h2>
<p>The <b>General</b> category contains the core application‑wide settings for the LSB environment. This section provides access to several fundamental configuration options that influence how the LSB application behaves during everyday use. The settings included in this category are as follows, and each one plays a role in shaping the overall user experience.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-general.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Aggregation time window for multiple input parameter changes</b> — This setting specifies the duration, in milliseconds, of a time window used to aggregate multiple input‑parameter updates for a single LSB view control. A control may define several input parameters, and in many scenarios multiple parameters may change at nearly the same moment or within a very short interval. If the aggregation window is set to 0 milliseconds, every individual parameter change immediately triggers its own data load and content refresh, which is typically undesirable because these updates should be consolidated into a single operation. By assigning a small non‑zero duration, all parameter changes that occur within that window are treated as a single combined update, resulting in only one data load and one content refresh. It is important to note that this window operates as a moving time window. For example, if the window length is D and the first parameter change occurs at <span class="tt">T₀</span>, and a second change occurs at <span class="tt">T₁</span> where <span class="tt">(T₁ − T₀) ≤ D</span>, both changes are merged into one action, and the actual data load/refresh is scheduled for <span class="tt">T₁ + D</span>. If a third change occurs at <span class="tt">T₂</span> where <span class="tt">(T₂ − T₁) ≤ D</span>, the refresh is postponed again to <span class="tt">T₂ + D</span>. This deferral continues until no further parameter changes occur within <span class="tt">D</span> milliseconds after the most recent change. In general, if n parameter updates occur close together (each pair separated by less than <span class="tt">D</span>), the final data load and refresh will occur at <span class="tt">Tₙ + D</span>. </li>
<li>
<b>Default view size</b> — This option defines the initial window dimensions applied when an LSB view is opened. Every newly opened view begins with this default size unless explicitly overridden elsewhere. </li>
<li>
<b>Select the icon theme for the application</b> — This setting determines which icon theme the LSB application uses. All available themes are presented in a selectable list, allowing the user to choose the preferred visual style. After selecting a new theme, the application must be restarted for the change to take effect. The current default theme is <span class="tt">default</span>. </li>
<li>
<b>Select the language for the application</b> - This setting sets the laguange to be used for the application UI. There is no other languages currently available for LSB, but some languages will be added soon. </li>
<li>
<b>Show the GIT client window during execution for enlistment or refresh</b> — The LSB application relies on Git to synchronize the default view repository, the help‑documentation repository, and any additional user‑configured repositories. During synchronization, the application invokes Git commands to update local files. This setting controls whether a console window is displayed while these Git operations are running. </li>
<li>
<b>Enable proxy server for Web requests at port</b> — This experimental feature enables an internal proxy server designed to route <a class="el" href="class_web_view.html" title="This WebView is a data view control for displaying data through Web page form.">WebView</a> requests that originate from local content (which typically has a null origin) to remote web endpoints, thereby mitigating CORS restrictions. Without this proxy, local pages are unable to access responses from remote servers unless those servers explicitly allow CORS requests — something that is uncommon in many environments. Enabling the proxy allows these local‑origin requests to succeed by transparently forwarding them through the proxy server. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Color &amp; Fonts category</h2>
<p>The <b>Colors &amp; Fonts</b> category includes all configuration options related to the visual appearance of the LSB application. Within this section, users can adjust the color schemes and font settings that determine how text, controls, and interface elements are rendered throughout the environment, allowing the overall look and readability of LSB to be customized to individual preferences.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-ui.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Active view caption</b> — These settings allow users to customize both the colors and the font used for the captions of active view controls. Users may click the foreground or background color fields to modify them, and use the <b>“Choose…”</b> button to select a different font for the active control’s caption. The <b>Preview</b> panel immediately reflects any adjustments, allowing users to see the final appearance of their changes in real time. </li>
<li>
<b>Inactive view caption</b> — These settings provide similar customization options for the captions of inactive view controls. Users can modify the foreground and background colors, as well as choose a different font by clicking the <b>“Choose…”</b> button. As with the active caption settings, the <b>Preview</b> panel updates instantly to show the resulting appearance of any changes made. </li>
<li>
<b>Shell window content</b> — This setting controls the colors and font used when displaying shell‑related windows, such as the Git console window that appears during view‑repository synchronization. Any modifications to these appearance settings are shown immediately in the <b>Preview</b> pane, ensuring users can verify the visual effect before applying the configuration. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Shells category</h2>
<p>The <b>Shells</b> category enables users to configure the command‑line environments that can be used within LSB views. This settings page includes a list of all registered shells, along with a set of tool buttons that allow users to add, remove, or modify entries in the shell list. These controls make it easy to manage which shells are available for executing scripts inside LSB views.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-shells.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Scan</b> - This button scans the host operating system for all available shells. Any shells that are detected are automatically added to the shell list using their default configuration settings. </li>
<li>
<b>Edit</b> - This button becomes enabled only when a shell entry in the list is selected. Clicking it opens the shell‑setting editor dialog, allowing the user to modify the configuration of the selected shell. For details on customizing shell settings, refer to the <b>“Edit settings for xxx”</b> section below. </li>
<li>
<b>Add</b> - This button creates a new shell entry in the shell list. It launches the shell‑setting editor dialog with empty fields so the user can define the configuration for the new shell. </li>
<li>
<b>Delete</b> - This button removes the currently selected shell from the shell list. It is enabled only when a shell entry is actively selected. </li>
<li>
<b>Clear</b> - This button removes all shell entries from the shell list at once. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Double‑clicking any item in the shell list performs the same action as clicking the Edit button; it opens the shell‑setting editor dialog so the user can update that shell’s configuration.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Edit settings for xxx</h3>
<p>This dialog is used to create and modify the configuration settings for a shell that will be available within the LSB application. An LSB view can execute shell scripts only when a corresponding shell definition has been configured, and this dialog is the primary interface through which those shell settings are established. In most cases, any shell intended for use in LSB views is first registered and customized through this editor.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-shell-editor.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here are the configuration options that can be defined for a shell: </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b> — The display name of the shell. This value also serves as the shell type referenced within shell scripts embedded in LSB views. </li>
<li>
<b>Path</b> — The absolute filesystem path to the shell’s executable program. </li>
<li>
<b>Reference / Module list</b> — A list of shell‑script files that will be automatically loaded when the shell process is created. The contents of these files are executed before any user‑defined scripts in the LSB view, allowing those scripts to rely on variables, helper functions, or utilities defined in the referenced modules. </li>
<li>
<b>Placeholders</b> — A set of placeholder tokens used within the script wrapper. Before execution, these placeholders are replaced with actual runtime values. They support the execution of the user‑defined script inside the shell process and help return data back to the LSB application. <ul>
<li>
<b>Customized user script</b> — The placeholder representing the user‑defined shell script embedded in the LSB view file. </li>
<li>
<b>Intermediate data file</b> — A placeholder that resolves to the full path of the temporary data file used to store output generated by the user‑defined script. After execution, the LSB application reads this file and uses the extracted data within the view. </li>
<li>
<b>First half of signature</b> — A placeholder for the first portion of a randomly generated signature value. This signature is used during script execution to detect completion and validate output. See <a class="el" href="group__section__wrapper__script.html">The Wrapper Script for Shells</a> for more details. </li>
<li>
<b>Second half of signature</b> — A placeholder for the second portion of the signature. Combined with the first half, it forms the complete signature used to mark the end of script execution. See <a class="el" href="group__section__wrapper__script.html">The Wrapper Script for Shells</a> for additional explanation. </li>
<li>
<b>Path to view file</b> — A placeholder that resolves to the full path of the currently opened LSB view file. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>User script wrapper</b> — A block of shell script that wraps the user‑defined script before execution. The wrapper is responsible for running the user script, writing its output to the intermediate data file, and emitting the signature data to the shell console to signal completion. Additional helper logic may also be included to support script execution. </li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Script execution timeout</b> — The default timeout applied to user‑defined script execution. Individual scripts may override this value through their <a class="el" href="class_script_data.html" title="This is the node that defines the configuration for generating data through script execution.">ScriptData</a> configuration in the LSB view file, see <a class="el" href="class_script_data.html" title="This is the node that defines the configuration for generating data through script execution.">ScriptData</a>. If no custom timeout is specified there, this default timeout is used.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Views category</h2>
<p>The <b>Views</b> category allows users to configure the set of view repositories that the LSB application relies on. This settings page includes a list of all registered view repositories, along with a collection of tool buttons that make it easy to add, remove, or modify repository entries. Through these controls, users can manage where LSB searches for view files and how those repositories are organized within the application.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-views.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Edit</b> — This button becomes available only when an LSB view repository is selected in the repository list. Clicking it opens the <b>“Edit view repository settings for xxx”</b> dialog, where the user can modify the configuration of the selected repository. Details on customizing repository settings are provided in the section below. </li>
<li>
<b>Synchronize</b> — This button is enabled when the selected LSB view repository is a Git‑based repository and a valid remote Git URL has been configured. Activating the button initiates a synchronization process that updates the local enlistment with the latest view files from the remote Git repository. </li>
<li>
<b>Add</b> — This button allows the user to create a new LSB view repository entry. It opens the <b>“Edit view repository settings for xxx”</b> dialog with empty fields so the user can define the settings for the new repository. </li>
<li>
<b>Delete</b> — This button removes the currently selected LSB view repository from the list. It is enabled only when a repository entry is actively selected. </li>
<li>
<b>Clear</b> — This button deletes all entries from the view repository list, effectively resetting the list to an empty state. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
Edit view repository settings for xxx</h3>
<p>When the user chooses to add a new LSB view repository or modify an existing one, the application opens this editor dialog to allow full customization of that repository’s settings. This dialog serves as the central interface for defining how the LSB application locates, accesses, and synchronizes the view files associated with the selected repository.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-repository-editor.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b> — The display name of the LSB view repository. This value appears in the Repository column of the view list shown in the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog, helping users identify which repository each view originates from. </li>
<li>
<b>Local view root</b> — The local filesystem path that points to the root directory of the repository. All LSB view files stored under this folder are treated as part of the repository. </li>
<li>
<b>GIT repository URL</b> — If the repository is synchronized from a remote Git source, this field specifies the URL of that remote Git repository. When this value is left empty, the repository is treated as a purely local repository, and no synchronization operations will be performed for it. </li>
<li>
<b>Refresh interval</b> — This setting applies only when the repository is linked to a remote Git source. It defines how frequently the LSB application should synchronize the local enlistment with the remote Git repository. Automatic synchronization occurs only during application startup and follows this interval. Manual synchronization — triggered by clicking the <b>Synchronize</b> button in the <b>Views</b> configuration page — ignores this interval and performs the update immediately. </li>
<li>
<b>The repository is enabled to use the views hosted in it</b> — This toggle determines whether the LSB views contained in the repository should appear in the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog. If the option is unchecked, the view files remain on the user’s machine but are intentionally hidden from the view list, effectively disabling the repository without removing it. </li>
</ul>
