<div class="contents">
<p>The LSB settings dialog allows user to configure various aspects of the LSB application. The settings are organized into four categories: <b>General</b>, <b>Colors &amp; Fonts</b>, <b>Shells</b>, and <b>Views</b>. Refer to the following sections to learn about each setting and understand how they affect the behavior of the LSB application.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
General</h2>
<p>This is the general setting category for LSB. The settings included in this category are,</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-general.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Aggregation time window for multiple input parameter changes</b> - This defines the length of a time window in milliseconds. For an LSB view control, there might be multiple input parameters, and several of these parameters might have their values changed simultaneously (or within a very short time frame). If this time window length is set to 0, every parameter value change will trigger a data load and content refresh in the view control, which is generally not the expected behavior. By setting this time window to a short duration, all parameter value changes occurring within this window will be recognized as one action, triggering a single data load and content refresh. Please note that this time window is a moving window. For instance, if the time window length is set to D and the first input parameter value changes at T0, and a second parameter changes at T1 (where T1 - T0 &lt;= D), these two input parameter changes will be recognized as one action, and the actual data load/content refresh will be triggered at T1 + D. If there is a third parameter value changes at T2 where T2 - T1 &lt;= D, then the action will deferred again to T2 + D, until no parameter value change happens within the D duration after the last parameter value change. In general, if n parameters have their values changed around the same time (with the time gap between each adjacent two parameters being less than D), the actual data load/content refresh will happen at Tn + D. </li>
<li>
<b>Default view size</b> - This defines the default window size for LSB view. When a LSB view is open, it will be set to this size by default. </li>
<li>
<b>Show the GIT client window during execution for enlistment or refresh</b> - The LSB application uses GIT to synchronize the default view repository, the help document repository, as well as other user configured view repositories. It calls the <code>git</code> command to get the files synced. This setting controls if a console window is shown during the synchronization. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Color &amp; Fonts</h2>
<p>This category contains the configurations for LSB UI, including colors and fonts, etc.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-ui.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Active view caption</b> - This setting allows user to configure the colors and font for the caption of active view controls. Users can click on the foreground or background color to change them, and click on the "Choose..." button to select the font for the active view control. The Preview control will display the final effect of any changes made to these configurations.</p>
<p class="endli">This configures the colors and font for the caption for the active view controls. User may click on the foreground color, background color to chage the colors, and click on the "Choose..." button to select the font for the active view control. The Preview control will show the final effect for any changes made on these configurations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Inactive view caption</b> - This configures the colors and font for the caption for the inactive view controls. It can be changed and previewed in the same way as the active view caption does. </li>
<li>
<b>Shell window content</b> - This is the setting for the shell window content. When a shell window is needed, such as the GIT console window mentioned above for the view synchronization, it will be displayed with the colors and font configured here. The settings can be changed and previewed in the same way as the active view caption and inactive view caption. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Shells</h2>
<p>This category allows the user to configure the shells used in LSB views. The page consists of a shell list and a set of tool buttons that manage the shell list.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-shells.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here are the tool buttons, </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Scan</b> - This scans shells in the host Operating System. The found shells will be added into the shell list automatically with default settings. </li>
<li>
<b>Edit</b> - This button is enabled only if an item in the shell list is selected. Clicking on the button will trigger the shell setting editor dialog to change the settings for the selected shell. See the "Shell Settings Editor" section below for the more details on how to customize the settings for a shell. </li>
<li>
<b>Add</b> - This adds a new shell into the shell list. It launches the shell setting editor dialog with empty settings for the new shell to be added. </li>
<li>
<b>Delete</b> - This deletes the currently selected shell from the shell list. It's only enabled if a shell item is selected in the shell list. </li>
<li>
<b>Clear</b> - This button removes all shells from the shell list. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: Double click on an item in the shell list has the same effect as clicking the <b>Edit</b> button - it launches the shell setting editor dialog for futher customization on the shell settings.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Shell Settings Editor</h3>
<p>This is the dialog used for creating and editing the settings for a shell to be used within the LSB application. The LSB views can execute shell scripts only if the corresponding shell setting exists, which must be created using this dialog.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-shell-editor.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here are the settings user can set for a shell, </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b> - Name of the shell. This value becomes the shell type in the view associated with any shell scripts. </li>
<li>
<b>Path</b> - The path to the shell executable </li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Reference / Module list</b> - This is is a list of shell script files. These files will be automatically loaded into the corresponding shell when the shell process is created, so the scripts in these files will be executed before any other scripts defined in the LSB view file. The shell scripts defined in the LSB view file can use the variables and functions created in these references or modules.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Placeholders</b> - These are placeholders to be used in the script wrapper which will be replaced by actual values before script execution. They are used to help the execution of the user specified script in the shell process, and collect data back to the LSB application. <ul>
<li>
<b>Customized user script</b> - This is the placeholder for the shell script defined in the LSB view file. </li>
<li>
<b>Intermediate data file</b> - This is the placeholder for the intermediate data file full path to store the data output from the user scripts defined in the LSB view file. The LSB application will try to load the script generated data from this intermediate data file and use the data in the LSB view. </li>
<li>
<b>First half of signature</b> - This placeholder is for the first half of the randomly generated signature data. Details about the signature data can be dound in the section <a class="el" href="group__section__wrapper__script.html">The Wrapper Script for Shells</a>. </li>
<li>
<b>Second half of signature</b> - This is placeholder for the second half of the randomly generated signature data. It's used together with the first half of signature data to form the complete signature. </li>
<li>
<b>Path to view file</b> - This is the placeholder for the full path to the currently open view file. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>User script wrapper</b> - This script wraps the user-defined script in an LSB view to be executed in the shell process. The wrapper script facilitates outputting data generated from the user-defined script into an intermediate data file, generating signature data, and outputting the signature data to the shell console to determine script completion. It can also add any other helper functions needed for the user script execution. </li>
<li>
<b>Script execution timeout</b> - This is the default timeout setting for the user script execution. Each user defined script could have its own customized timeout set through the script data source configuration, see <a class="el" href="class_script_data.html" title="This is the node that defines the configuration for generatign data through script execution.">ScriptData</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Views</h2>
<p>This category allows users to configure the view repositories used in LSB. Similar to the Shells, this page consists of a view repository list and a set of tool buttons that manage the view repository list.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-settings-views.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here are the tool buttons, </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Edit</b> - This button is enabled only if a view repository is selected in the repository list. Clicking on the button will open the view repository editor dialog to update the settings for the LSB view repository. See section below for the details of how to customize the settings for a view repository. </li>
<li>
<b>Synchronize</b> - If the currently selected view repository is a GIT repository and the remote GIT repository URL is provided, this button will be enabled. Clicking on the button will trigger the synchronization of the view files (from the remote GIT repository to the local enlistment). </li>
<li>
<b>Add</b> - This is to add a new view repository into the repository list. It launches the view repository setting dialog with empty settings for the new view repository. </li>
<li>
<b>Delete</b> - This deletes the currently selected view repository from the repository list. The button is enabled only if a view repository item is selected in the view repository list.  </li>
<li>
<b>Clear</b> - This removes all view repositories from the repository list. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
View Repository Editor</h3>
<p>When user requests to add a new LSB view repository or edit an existing view repository, this editor dialog is launched for customizing the settings for the view repository.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-repository-editor.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here are the settings can be customized for a view repository though this dialog, </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b> - Name of the LSB view repository </li>
<li>
<b>Local view root</b> - This is the local path to the root folder of the view repository. </li>
<li>
<b>GIT repository URL</b> - If a view repository is synchronized from a remote GIT repository, this is the GIT repository URL. If it's empty, then the view repository becomes a local repository, no synchronization will be executed for it. </li>
<li>
<b>Refresh interval</b> - This setting is only applicable if the view repository is synchronized from a remote GIT repository. It controls the frequency of synchronization between the LSB local enlistment and the remote GIT repository. Please note that automatic synchronization only occurs when LSB is launched. Additionally, manual synchronization by clicking the Synchronize button in the Views configuration page does not adhere to this interval setting; it performs the synchronization immediately when the button is clicked. </li>
<li>
<b>The repository is enabled to use the views hosted in it</b> - This is a switch that controls if the LSB views in this view repository should be visible in the open view dialog or not. </li>
</ul>
