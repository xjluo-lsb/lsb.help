<div class="contents">
<p>The LSB application uses a multi‑window, multiple‑document interface (MDI). At startup, only the main window is displayed, containing the menu bar and toolbar. When the user opens an LSB view file — whether from the menu or the toolbar — the view is loaded into its own independent window. Opening the same file again creates an additional window for that new instance. Each LSB view, regardless of whether it comes from the same file or a different one, always runs in its own dedicated window.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
1. Main window</h2>
<p>Here's the main window of the LSB application,</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-main-window.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
1.1 Menu</h3>
<h4 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
1.1.1 The <b>File</b> menu</h4>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-menu-file.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Open view ...</b> - Opens the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog, allowing the user to choose a view file from the LSB view list and load it as an LSB view. </li>
<li>
<b>Open recent view</b> - A sub‑menu containing entries for previously opened LSB views. Selecting an item reopens that specific view immediately. </li>
<li>
<b>Close all views</b> - Closes all currently open LSB view windows. </li>
<li>
<b>Manage view history ...</b> - Opens the <b>“Manage opened view history”</b> dialog, where the user can configure how previously opened view files are ordered within the <b>“Open recent view”</b> sub‑menu. </li>
<li>
<b>Exit</b> - Closes all open LSB view windows and exits the LSB application. </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
1.1.2 The <b>Windows</b> menu</h4>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-menu-windows.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Views</b> - A sub‑menu listing all currently open LSB views. Choosing an item brings that view’s window to the front and makes it the active view. </li>
<li>
<b>Global log window</b> - A toggle that shows or hides the <b>“Global logging”</b> window. If the window is not currently visible, selecting this option displays it and brings it forward. If it is already visible, selecting the option hides it without closing it. The <b>“Global logging”</b> window records view open/close events as well as other application‑level activities. </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
1.1.3 The <b>Option</b> menu</h4>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-menu-option.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Settings ...</b> - This is currently the sole item in the <b>“Option”</b> menu. Selecting it opens the LSB <b>“Settings”</b> dialog, where the user can adjust all application‑level configurations, including <b>General</b> settings, <b>Colors &amp; Fonts</b> configurations, <b>Shells</b> settings, and <b>Views</b> repository configurations. </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
1.1.4 The <b>Help</b> menu</h4>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-menu-help.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Help ...</b> - Opens the <b>“LSB Help”</b> window, which displays the help documentation for the LSB application, including the page currently being viewed. </li>
<li>
<b>License ...</b> - Opens the <b>License</b> page, which describes the license used for the application, how business users can use the application for comercial purpose. </li>
<li>
<b>About ...</b> - Opens the <b>“About LSB”</b> dialog, which provides information about the application and credits the SDK libraries and other resources used in its development. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
1.2 Toolbar Buttons</h3>
<p>The main window includes a toolbar that provides quick access to several key functions. All of these functions are also available through the main menu. On macOS, where the application menu appears in the system’s global menu bar, the toolbar becomes the only visible element in the application’s main window.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-main-window.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Open view</b> – Performs the same action as the <b>“Open view …”</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu. Clicking it opens the <b>“Open a view”</b> dialog for selecting and loading an LSB view. The adjacent triangle opens a drop‑down list showing the same recent‑view history as the <b>Open recent view</b> sub‑menu; selecting an entry opens that view immediately. </li>
<li>
<b>Close all views</b> – Matches the <b>“Close all views”</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu and closes all currently open LSB views. </li>
<li>
<b>View history</b> – Another way to open the <b>“Manage opened view history”</b> dialog, where the ordering of items in the <b>Open recent view</b> sub‑menu can be configured. </li>
<li>
<b>Views</b> – Enabled only when at least one LSB view is open. It opens the <b>“Select view”</b> dialog, allowing the user to choose from all open views and activate the selected one. The accompanying triangle button opens a drop‑down list of all open views; selecting one brings that view to the front. </li>
<li>
<b>Global logs</b> – Toggles the visibility of the <b>“Global logging”</b> window. If the window is hidden, clicking the button shows it and brings it forward. </li>
<li>
<b>Settings</b> – Opens the <b>“Settings”</b> dialog, where users can adjust the application’s configuration. </li>
<li>
<b>Help page</b> – Displays the <b>“LSB Help”</b> window containing the application’s help documentation. </li>
<li>
<b><a class="el" href="class_about.html" title="This is the node for defining content of about information for an LSB view.">About</a> LSB</b> – Opens the <b>“About LSB”</b> dialog, which provides information about the application. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
2. LSB View window</h2>
<p>An LSB view window generally includes at least four pages, <b>View</b>, <b>Logs</b>, <b>Lua</b> and <b>About</b>.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
2.1 View page</h3>
<p>The <b>View</b> page displays content produced from the XML configuration defined within the LSB view file. A wide range of controls — including both input widgets and data‑presentation components — are arranged throughout the view using various layout managers that determines their structure and positioning. In the <b>“File Explorer View”</b> example below, the root layout is a horizontal <a class="el" href="class_split_layout.html" title="The SplitLayout is a layout control that supports hosting two child views side by side.">SplitLayout</a>: the left pane contains a <a class="el" href="class_file_tree_view.html" title="This FileTreeView is a data view control that uses a tree view to display the folder structures under...">FileTreeView</a> that shows the folder hierachy, while the right pane contains a vertical <a class="el" href="class_split_layout.html" title="The SplitLayout is a layout control that supports hosting two child views side by side.">SplitLayout</a>. Within this vertical <a class="el" href="class_split_layout.html" title="The SplitLayout is a layout control that supports hosting two child views side by side.">SplitLayout</a>, a <a class="el" href="class_file_list_view.html" title="This FileListView is a data view control that uses a list view to display files and/or folders under ...">FileListView</a> at the top lists all files located in the folder currently selected in the <a class="el" href="class_file_tree_view.html" title="This FileTreeView is a data view control that uses a tree view to display the folder structures under...">FileTreeView</a>, and a <a class="el" href="class_text_view.html" title="This TextView is a data view control for displaying single line or multiple lines of plain text.">TextView</a> at the bottom displays the contents of whichever file is selected in the <a class="el" href="class_file_list_view.html" title="This FileListView is a data view control that uses a list view to display files and/or folders under ...">FileListView</a>. This arrangement provides a complete, interactive file‑browsing experience within a single LSB view.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-view.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
2.2 Logs page</h3>
<p>The <b>Logs</b> page records all local logging activity, providing a detailed account of every event generated within the active LSB view instance. Each control within the view performs a condition check — by default an empty script that always evaluates to true — to decide whether its associated data source should be accessed or refreshed and whether the control’s displayed content should be updated accordingly. The outcomes of these condition checks are displayed in the <b>Message list</b> at the top of the page. When a control updates one of its output parameters and that update subsequently triggers a corresponding input parameter change in another control, both of these related events are captured in the <b>Parameter change list</b> shown at the bottom. This logging mechanism helps view creators debug their designs by confirming that output parameters are being emitted with the correct values and that those values are successfully delivered to the intended target controls through their input parameters.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-logs.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
2.3 Lua page</h3>
<p>The <b>Lua</b> page displays the Lua code snippets that are executed as part of the active LSB view instance. This page is always present, even when the view does not define any explicit Lua scripts, because every LSB view relies on a set of built‑in Lua functions that operate behind the scenes. These internal Lua routines run throughout the entire lifecycle of the view, from the moment it is loaded to the point where parameter values are evaluated and checked. For example, the system automatically generates an table named <b>lsb</b> within the Lua runspace, allowing Lua code to access shared information such as the view’s file path, file name, and view name, etc. All condition checks for view controls are written exclusively in Lua. The Lua page itself is read‑only and presents the executed Lua code with full syntax highlighting for easier inspection and understanding.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-lua.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
2.4 About page</h3>
<p>The <b>About</b> page presents descriptive information related to the specific LSB view. All content shown on this page is fully configurable within the LSB view file, allowing creators to define exactly what appears there. This information may be produced directly from data embedded in the view file itself, or it can instead be sourced from an external web page that is publicly accessible on the Internet.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-about.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
2.5 Other pages</h3>
<p>If the view author incorporates external shells such as PowerShell, Bash, or Zsh to implement functionalities within an LSB view, the system automatically adds additional pages — one for each shell type used. Each of these shell‑specific pages displays the executed shell scripts together with the full output they produced. Both the view creator and the end user can rely on these pages to review the exact commands that were run and examine their resulting output, helping verify that the view’s content is being refreshed and updated correctly based on the underlying shell logic.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
3. Dialogs</h2>
<p>The LSB application makes use of several different dialogs that are employed throughout the interface to present various types of data and to allow users to modify configuration settings for the application. These dialogs serve as dedicated interfaces for viewing information and adjusting options that influence how the application behaves.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
3.1 Open a view dialog</h3>
<p>The <b>Open a view</b> dialog allows users to locate, choose, and open an LSB view file within the LSB application. The dialog is composed of two main sections: a view list and a preview pane. It automatically scans all configured view repositories, discovers available LSB view files, and populates the view list accordingly. When the user highlights a specific LSB view in the list, detailed information about that view appears in the preview pane. The view list also supports the smart‑filter feature (see <a class="el" href="group__section__smart__filter.html">The Smart Filtering in ListView</a> for details), which enables users to quickly narrow down the list by applying combinations of column‑based filters. After selecting a view, the user can additionally click the <b>“Open the view folder”</b> button to open the directory containing the view file using the operating system’s native file manager, such as <b>File Explorer</b> on Windows or <b>Finder</b> on macOS.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-open-view.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
3.2 Manage opened view history</h3>
<p>This dialog controls how the view‑opening history is presented in the <b>“Open recent view”</b> sub‑menu located under the <b>“File”</b> menu.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-manage-history.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>History count settings</b> <ul>
<li>
<b>Maximum item count in menu</b> - This option determines how many entries appear in the <b>“Open recent view”</b> sub‑menu. The allowed range is from 1 to 9 inclusive, and the value must always remain smaller than the <b>Maximum item count in history file</b> setting. </li>
<li>
<b>Maximum item count in history file</b> - This option specifies how many previously opened view entries are saved in the persistent history data file. The valid range is from 1 to 99 inclusive, and the value must be greater than the <b>Maximum item count in menu</b> setting. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>How are the view files ordered</b> <ul>
<li>
<b>Most recently used time</b> - When selected, the list of view files is sorted according to the most recent time each view was opened. </li>
<li>
<b>How many times view used</b> - When selected, the list is sorted based on how frequently each view file has been opened. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>View file history</b> - This section displays the complete list of previously opened view files. The ordering of this list depends on the selected sorting option above, meaning it will either follow the most‑recently‑used order or the usage‑count order. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
3.3 Select view</h3>
<p>The dialog appears when the user clicks the <b>View</b> button in the main window’s toolbar. It presents a complete list of all LSB views that are currently open within the application. When the user selects one of the listed views and then confirms the selection by clicking the <b>OK</b> button, that view is immediately brought to the front of the interface and becomes the active, focused view.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lsb-view-list.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
3.4 Settings</h3>
<p>The LSB <b>Settings</b> dialog is not described in this section; instead, its full explanation is provided in the following section titled <b>“The LSB Settings.”</b> That section offers a detailed overview of all configuration options available within the dialog. </p>
