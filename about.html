<a href="https://www.wxishiko.com/wxCharts/" target="_blank">wxCharts</a>, 
and <a href="https://soci.sourceforge.net/">SOCI</a>. The LSB also uses <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a> as
embedded language in the LSB view files. Besides, it comes with a set of icon files acquired from the
<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">FLATICON</a>, more specifically, created by smashicons and freepik. The links to the original
icon files together with attribution following
